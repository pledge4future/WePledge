# Errors

## Debugging backend containers

Before rebuilding all backend docker containers, do the following:
1. Delete all files except for the *__init__.py* in the folder *./WePledge/backend/src/emissions/migrations*.
2. Delete all backend containers (wepledge_pgadmin_1, wepledge_backend_1 and db)
3. Run `docker volume prune` to delete the database.
4. Run `docker compose upÂ´.


## `Module not found` in backend container

The backend container won't build correctly, because `Module not found django_extensions`.

**Solution:** Delete all containerst and images. Then run `docker volume prune` to delete all data associated with them.


## Send Registration email failed

When registering a new user, sending the activation email fails.

**Solution:** Add the `EMAIL_FROM` variable to `settings.py` (see [Django-Graphql_Auth Docs](https://django-graphql-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings/))

```
GRAPHQL_AUTH = {
    'LOGIN_ALLOWED_FIELDS': ['email'],
    'SEND_ACTIVATION_EMAIL': True,
    'EMAIL_FROM': 'no-reply@pledge4future.org',
}
```

## `Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file`

```
Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: process_linux.go:545: container init cau

" caused: mount through procfd: not a directory: unknown: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host pat

```


**Solution:** 

1. Make sure the .env file in `./WePledge` exists. If not create it. 
2. Delete all folders which were created by docker called `.env` in `./WePledge` and `./WePledge/backend/src`.
3. Delete all containers, images and volumes and run `docker compose up --build` again.
