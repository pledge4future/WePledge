## Debugging backend containers

Before rebuilding all backend docker containers, do the following: 

1. Delete all files except for the *__init__.py* in the folder *./WePledge/backend/src/emissions/migrations*.
2. Delete all backend containers (wepledge_pgadmin_1, wepledge_backend_1 and db)
3. Run `docker volume prune` to delete the database. 
4. Run `docker compose upÂ´.
